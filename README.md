# Sentiment-Analysis-using-TextBlob

- You will find 2 different Jupyter Notebook files here.

1.**Sentiment Analysis using TextBlob** Jupyter Notebook
(_**Task is to confirm if the positive reviews are actually positive reviews or not using TextBlob**_)

2.**Sentiment Analysis on Sarcasm** Jupyter Notebook
(_**Task is to do sentiment analysis on sarcasm and make a conclusion**_)



 **Note:** Wikipedia sums *sarcasm* as *the use of words usually used to either mock or annoy someone, or for humorous purposes,and is largely context-dependent.*
 *Sarcasm is a type of sentiment where people express their negative feelings using positive or intensified positive words.*

- Note from EmreYbs:  I finished a lovely course called **"Awesome Natural Language Processing Tools In Python"** *by Jesse E.Agbe(JCharis).*
- This is one of the exercises we needed to complete. I recommend all courses by Jesse, in Udemy. 
- At first, his English accent can be a bit difficult to understand but then you get used to and his courses are very useful. I also recommend his *"Building Commandline Tools"* course if you need tools that you can use in your terminal.
