- Note from EmreYbs:  I finished a lovely course called "Awesome Natural Language Processing Tools In Python" by Jesse E.Agbe(JCharis).
- This is one of the exercises we needed to complete. I recommend all courses by Jesse, in Udemy. 
- At first, his English accent can be a bit difficult to understand but then you get used to and his courses are very useful. I also recommend his *"Building Commandline Tools"* course if you need tools that you can use in your terminal.
